Dogvibes is social music. Music is output from one place but is controlled from any connected device. Such devices can be your laptop, phone, remote control or whatever solution that connects with our easy-to-use interface. The music player currently plays Spotify and more formats are on their way. Future plans include integrating services such as Last.fm and playback on Apple Airport Express.

For the tech guys: Dogvibes was the first Linux audio player to fully integrate Spotify using their released library. The Dogvibes project consists of a fully working Spotify GStreamer source, a Python server handling playback control via either REST or WebSocket requests and a web client that imitates the Spotify UI (to lawyers: just for fun though, we won't sell it).

Note that at the moment Dogvibes can be quite hard to install. Documentation is not that extensive and some parts and dependencies are surely missing. But we're working on it!
